<dvhart> lo all
--> ank (~anand.tiw@beowulf.mcs.sdsmt.edu) has joined #linux-coding
<carter_> re
<carter_> hi darren!
<dvhart> lo marc
<dvhart> ready
<carter_> so
<carter_> lets talk bout the uml :)
<carter_> yep
<carter_> :)
<dvhart> update your cvs
<carter_> cvs server  is up?
<dvhart> slightly updated uml
<carter_> had some access problems last week
<dvhart> yeah we had power outages
<dvhart> its up now
<carter_> ok
<ank> i m new to uml, i this the right channel to hang around for uml
<carter_> updating
<dvhart> well
<carter_> ank: right channel for a bit talk about coding
<dvhart> we are goin to be discussing some
<carter_> but not much at the moment ;)
<ank> k 
<carter_> we two are just discussing some GUI Toolkit we are working on
<carter_> atm
<dvhart> http://www.dvhart.com/projects.php
<dvhart> see libstk
<dvhart> you can get the dia uml form the web cvs browser if you are interested: libstk/doc/uml.dia
<carter_> damn that connection is slow :)(cvs)
<dvhart> cable upload
<dvhart> sucketh
<dvhart> it'll be nice when I can have my own t1
<carter_> you get your own T1?
<carter_> *wow*
<dvhart> "it'll be nice when..."
<carter_> these connections are unaffordable here ;)
<ank> i m interested in somethng like ipc/ distributed ipc, which channel will be good 
<carter_> dunno ank
<dvhart> ank no sure either
<ank> but i will stick here to learn something ;)
<dvhart> carter_: while you are downloading her are the topic I want to discuss
<dvhart> 1"list/combo
<carter_> dvhart: cant get anything trough the ssh pipe atm
<carter_> something's wrong
<dvhart> hmm
* carter_ tries to ssh manually to test
<dvhart> cvs and ssh work for me
<dvhart> 1: list/combo parent
<dvhart> 2: container model (vs QT's)
<carter_> ok
* carter_ doesnt know QT very good
<dvhart> 3: application aware of state (vs QT)
<carter_> s/good/well
<carter_> ok ssh works now
<dvhart> I just read their docs / clas hierarchy and whitepaper this morning in prep
<carter_> updating
<carter_> gimme a link to it
<dvhart> 4: new surface model
<carter_> hmm weird
<carter_> ssh manully works
<carter_> carter@voyager libstk $ cvs update
<carter_>  
<carter_> carter@www.dvhart.com's password:
<carter_>  
<carter_> hangs there forever
<dvhart> tp://doc.trolltech.com/3.1/index.html
<dvhart> http://doc.trolltech.com/3.1/index.html
<carter_> ok
<dvhart> see Whitepaper, and All Classes
<dvhart> and the Tutorials
<dvhart> but I gleaned what I think we need from them
<dvhart> 5: event model
<carter_> ok
<carter_> updated
<dvhart> 6: button group and toggle buttons
<dvhart> any topics you want to add
<carter_> wait
<carter_> will look at the uml first (updated version)
<dvhart> ( with the list we can be sure to cover them all)
<dvhart> dammit, I didn't finsih the IRC whiteboard!  *g*
<dvhart> ank: for some background, we are designing a toolkit for set-top boxes.  Designed to be light, powerful, abstracted from the event and graphics system, written in TRUE C++, using boost
<dvhart> this is version 2
<carter_> TRUE C++ (the only real language *ggg*)
<dvhart> (version 1 was a good proof of concept, but not TRUE C++, dvhart had some maturing to do *g*)
<dvhart> 7: parent type specified in constructor
<carter_> ok
<carter_> lets start with 1.
<dvhart> one sec
<dvhart> 1: list/combo parent
<dvhart> 2: container model (vs QT's)
<dvhart> 3: application aware of state (vs QT)
<dvhart> 4: new surface model
<dvhart> 5: event model
<dvhart> 6: button group and toggle buttons
<dvhart> 7: parent type specified in constructor
<dvhart> ok better
<dvhart> so list combo now have widget as parent
<dvhart> we will add a add_item()
<dvhart> change_item, remove_item interface
<carter_> they have container as a parent
<carter_> dont they?
<dvhart> parent or base class do yo you mean?
<carter_> ah
<carter_> ok
<carter_> you mean the  parent in the class hierarchie :)
* carter_ thought of the parent pointer in the runtime hierarchie
<dvhart> ah
<dvhart> right
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> so we don't use the add_child interface, we use add_item
<carter_> yep
<carter_> imo
<dvhart> which we pass ... strings?
<carter_> we should give them an STL style container interface
<dvhart> good thought
<carter_> so we have push_back etc + a simple iterator
<carter_> in the easiest case
<dvhart> public list container?
<carter_> we can just return the STL iterator
<carter_> for the internal container
<carter_> hmmm
<carter_> no
<carter_> not public
<carter_> just the same interface as the STL uses
<carter_> implemented in our code
<carter_> (pass trough to real STL at first)
<carter_> hmmmmm
<carter_> imo the items should be a class
<carter_> with a virtual draw function
<dvhart> they could be the label class
<carter_> so you could implement "owner draw" for the widgets
<dvhart> then they could have images too
<carter_> the thing is
<carter_> does a label widget "fit" into a list?
* carter_ thinks of list items as much more light weight
<dvhart> hmm, right
<dvhart> ok, list_item then
<dvhart> with an image if they want
<carter_> imo
<carter_> list item should be like this
<carter_> class list_item
<carter_> {public:
<carter_> std::string caption;
* dvhart smacks carter
<carter_> virtual void draw(/* params have to be defined*/) ; // with a default implementation
<carter_> }
<carter_> ;
<carter_> *ouch*?
<carter_> :)
<dvhart> caption private
<carter_> ok
<carter_> right
<carter_> that was pseudo code wasnt it ?: )
<dvhart> *g*
<dvhart> yeah agreed, looks good
<dvhart> next?
<dvhart> wait, with image support
<carter_> image support
<carter_> the user derives a  class from list item:)
<dvhart> (in the list_item I mean)
<carter_> and customizes the draw function
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter_> if he need image support
<dvhart> why?
<dvhart> why not do it like button and label?
<carter_> ok
<carter_> you can put that functionality in the base  class
<carter_> but
<carter_> if i have a virtual function for drawing anyway
<carter_> i should use it right? :)
<dvhart> yeah and you can override default drawing behavior (ie where th eimage goes)
<carter_> yep
<carter_> and you can do multi-column combi boxes
<carter_> if you like to, etc
<dvhart> yup
<carter_> so
<carter_> to make that works
<carter_> the listbox has to use smart pointers
<carter_>  to items internally
<carter_> otherwise we cant put derived items there (they would be aliased to the base class if we pass them around by value)
<dvhart> std::list<boost:shared_ptr list_item>
<carter_> yep
<dvhart> ok
--- carter_ is now known as carter
<dvhart> (carter is public now *g*)
<carter> (did i mention that GNome2.2 roxx? )
<dvhart> yes it does
<carter> ok
<carter> point 2
<carter> container modell (versus QT)
<dvhart> ok, so QTs model
* carter is still not into QT
<dvhart> they don't have a container
<dvhart> they have a QObject (like our event_handler really)
<dvhart> and it define sthe child vector
<dvhart> any widget can have children
<dvhart> ... I don't like it
* carter neither
<dvhart> like ours?
<carter> yep
<dvhart> I had a UI professor say that the UML din't show that a container could have a container
<carter> for many widgets it simply makes no sense to be containers
<dvhart> not sure where he got that
<carter> hmmm?????
<carter> ok
<carter> the UML is imperfect
<dvhart> since our container contains widgets and container inherits widget it can contain other containers, I htought the UML does show that (but this is my first REAL UML dia)
<carter> there is an relation between the container and the widget missing
<carter> with an 0:n multiplicity
<carter>  :)
<dvhart> hmm want to add that and commit ?
<dvhart> don't know how that is supposed to look
* carter is atm not sure about the notation ;)
<carter> rational rose does that automaticly :)
<dvhart> ok, I'll  liik into it
<dvhart> look even
<carter> yep
<carter> ok
<carter> so we both like our modell
<carter> so we take it :)
<carter> 3.Application aware of state (in relation to QT's modell)
<carter> dunno about QT
<dvhart> so the children_ aggregate connection isn't enough?
<carter> explain that a bit more
<carter> the children aggregate connection is missing that there can be more than one children :)
<carter> otherwise its right
<dvhart> ok, in QT there is a global.. qApp pointer or something, you never add widgets to the app.
<dvhart> I am not sure how the app gets to be aware of them to pass events
<carter> ahh found how to do the multiplicity thing in DIA
<carter> :)will commit in a few mins ;)
<dvhart> ok
* carter hopes he remembers the right notation
<dvhart> go ahead and take any notes your want on the dia file, I won't touch it until you commit
<carter> dvhart: Global variables are a cheap hack
<dvhart> I agree
<dvhart> just a difference I wanted to explore
<dvhart> we add states to the app
<carter> imo that wrong
<dvhart> they never do
<carter> do they have "states" in our sense?
<carter> i think they dont
<dvhart> I think our model works well for our target applications
<carter> yep
<carter> thats what i thought
<dvhart> (they don't have states)
<carter> its highly possible
<carter> that they get their events from the underlying windows system
<carter> in a different way then we do
<carter> ya know in Win32 every widget is a window for itself and the system dispatches messages
<dvhart> does our model make sense with app and widget descending from event_handler?  (QT does something similar, they both derive from QObject)
<dvhart> ah
<carter> i think it makes sense
<carter> for our application
<dvhart> is event_handler a good name?
<carter> hmmm
<carter> thought about that
<dvhart> maybe just object
<carter> maybe we should create some naming convention for purely abstract baseclasses(interfaces)
<dvhart> good thought, what do you suggest?
<carter> ievent_handler was what i used in DSP/newworlds
<dvhart> iWidget
<dvhart> lol
<dvhart> HA
<carter> :)))
<dvhart> great minds..
<carter> but my taste is a bit different today
<carter> dunno but i think
<carter> event_handler is good enough
<carter> makes it clear what function the object derived has
<dvhart> I like the interface distinction though
<dvhart> that way it is clear to the developer what he/she is doing
<carter> i think we should just document it
<dvhart> theres a thought
* carter is strongly against most name prefixing/postfixing
<dvhart> hmmm
<dvhart> ok, doxygen it is
<carter> yep
<carter> :)
<dvhart> ok, we stick with our hierarchy
<carter> yep
<carter> 4: new surface modell?
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> before we had a fb for every widget and the app
<dvhart> evil
<dvhart> now we have one in app
<carter> fb?
<carter> framebuffer?
<dvhart> and pass it as a graphics object to the draw routines
<dvhart> (yup)
<carter> imo we should have one surface in each widget
<carter> but that doesnt mean each surface
<carter> has its own framebuffer
* carter thought of surfaces as handles for clipped drrawing to a spezified region of the screen
<dvhart> (it does in the current surface definition)
<carter> ok
<carter> then we have to change that
<dvhart> currently (the new model)
<carter> so a surface can possibly be a subsurface of another one
<carter> that was my plan
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter> (directfb and SDL support that on the lower level too)
<carter> IIRC
<dvhart> what is wrong with drawing bottom up and passing the graphics object around
<dvhart> it is fast, light, no blitting, etc
<carter> ok
<carter> first thing
<carter> how do you want to do clipping?
<dvhart> you set the clip rect in the surface
<carter> ok
<dvhart> draw out of it and it gets.. well clipped
<carter> ok
<dvhart> *g*
<carter> then thats ok
<carter> so
<carter> who's responsible for setting the clipping rectangle
<carter> the widget drawing function
<dvhart> we need to decide
<carter> or the drawing tree traverser (if we'll have such a thing)
* dvhart hasn't given much thought to clipping
<dvhart> the widget maintains relative x,y and its width and height
<dvhart> (relative to its parent)
<carter> ok
<dvhart> at least that is my current thoughts
<carter> so we only need to clip
<carter> to the bottom right edge really
<carter> ok
<carter> and to zero :)
<carter> the next thing would be who calls the draw function
<dvhart> trying to think what we really need clipping for?
<carter> imo the state or the app should have a drawing function
<carter> which goes trough the widget hierarchie
<carter> setups clipping
<carter> and calls the function
<carter> dvhart: clipping is imo usefull for example for the listbox
<carter> so when we scroll it
<carter> nothing gets drawn out of the area :)
<dvhart> hmm ok
<carter> its more of protection of our own dumbness
<dvhart> so pseudo code coming:
<carter> that a neccesity
<dvhart> state::draw()
<dvhart> for each widget
<dvhart> set clip
<dvhart> widget.draw
<dvhart> end
<carter> recurse
<dvhart> yup
<carter> otherwise its right
<carter> IMO
<dvhart> containers call draw on each child
<carter> so
<carter> when do we redraw
<carter> hmmm
<carter> no dvhart
<carter> bad plan
<dvhart> why? it ensures bottom up
<carter> forces  us to do always full screen redraws
<carter> ah
<carter> no
<carter> right
<carter> ok
<carter> if the container does draw on each child its ok
<carter> :)
<dvhart> the beauty of only one surface
<carter> so
<carter> if one widget gets "invalid"
<carter> it calls redraw on its parent
<carter> ?
<dvhart> ?
<carter> if for example
<carter> i set the Caption of a button
<dvhart> oh yeah, sure
<carter> it has to be redrawn
<carter> good
* dvhart taking a note about that
<carter> ok
<carter> thats it mostly about the drawing system
<dvhart> should that be handled with signals? or just parent_->draw()
<dvhart> ?
<dvhart> ah
<dvhart> no
<dvhart> can't
<carter> parent_ draw simply
<dvhart> draw needs the graphics object
<dvhart> and the widget doesn't have it
<carter> hmmmm
<carter> who has it ?:)
<dvhart> app
<carter> hmmmm
<dvhart> hmmm
<dvhart> we could send an event
<carter> hmmm
<dvhart> redraw and our rect
<carter> maybe we should make widget aware of app
<dvhart> eh.. yuk
<dvhart> I have been trying to avoid that
<carter> hmmmmmm
<dvhart> that basicly amount to a global pointer (albeit local to each widget)
<carter> ok
<carter> so
<carter> we could just go the hierarchie upwards
<carter> till we are at the top
<carter> when we want to redrwa
<carter> we then have the surface to draw
<dvhart> but then everything get redrawn just to change the widget label
<carter> and we can pass it to our parent
<carter> no
<carter> i just go completely up to get the screen
<dvhart> oh
<carter> not to redraw from there
<dvhart> request the surface from the parent
<dvhart> and on up
<carter> 3 lines recursive function ;)
<dvhart> then pass it to the parent
<carter> we should put that functionality
<carter> in widget
<carter> imo
<dvhart> did I understand you right ^
<carter> yep
* dvhart noting
<carter> hmmm
<carter> that would be mean
<carter> hmmmm
<carter> unclean unclean
<carter> :)
<carter> we would have to use RTTI
<carter> to detect when we reached application
<dvhart> no
<carter> or we had to expand event handler
<dvhart> just call parent->get_surface
<dvhart> default is to do the same
<carter> so
<dvhart> the app returns the surface
<carter> what do you do in state?
<dvhart> app is states parent
<carter> lol
<carter> but
<carter> that only w*orks
<carter> if you
<carter> put
<carter> get_surface
<carter> into event handler
<carter> because otherwise they havent got a common base class
<dvhart> damn
<carter> hmm
<carter> maybe
<carter> we should tweak the hierarchie
<carter> to have a class between event handler and widget/application
<carter> and then we can put multiple interfaces
<carter> into that class
<carter> via multiple inheritance
<carter> hmmmm
<carter> wait
<carter> have to sketch that
* dvhart pondering
<carter> wait
<carter> will commit to cvs
<dvhart> dia?
<carter> ignore the naming for now
<carter> couldnt think of good names :)
<carter> dia
<dvhart> ok
<carter> commited
<dvhart> got it
<carter> with that interface
<carter> your plan would work
<carter> and the distinction between event handling interface code and the drawing interface code
<carter> is still intact
<dvhart> yup
<carter> but i dont really like it:(
<dvhart> surface_getter *chuckle*
<carter> *ggggg*
<dvhart> yeah, it seems a hack doesn' it
<carter> i told you i couldnt think of sensible names :)
<carter> hmmmm
<carter> it doesnt seems like a hack
<carter> but i have the fear
<carter> that we will tend to add hundreds of classes there at the top of the hierarchie :)
<dvhart> right
<dvhart> and why parent interface? 
<carter> couldnt think of a better name
<dvhart> jsut so app and widget don't have multiple inheritance?
<carter> its the interface
<carter> no
<carter> its the interface
<carter> all parents support
<carter> by the parent pointer
<carter> so i named it parent_interface ;)
<carter> it contains everything that  can be done
<carter> by going the hierarchie up with the parent pointer
<dvhart> I see
<dvhart> I don't think I like it
<dvhart> but I don't have a better solution atm
<carter> imo its not that bad
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter> it just opens up the possibility to add too much to the hierarchie ;)
<dvhart> we could throw event_h surface_g and parent_i into one stk::object class
<dvhart> and it would still make sense
<carter> imo
<carter> that is uncleaner
<carter> than compositing it via multiple inheritence
<carter> (the compiler generated code would be the same anyway :))) )
<dvhart> yours has a nice division of resposibility
<carter> yep
<dvhart> hmmm... will think on that some more
<dvhart> 5?
<carter> event systemIIRC
<carter> imo the current one is right
<carter> app gets an event
<carter> sends it to current_widget
<carter> and that one passes it upward the widget hierarchie
<carter> trough event_handler
<carter> till its handled
<dvhart> I like it too
<dvhart> what event should we have
<dvhart> key_event
<dvhart> mouse_event
<carter> yep
<dvhart> where do IR and network event come in?
<carter> hmmmm
<dvhart> message_event?
<carter> imo
<carter> networking should have NOTHING todo
<carter> with our widget set :)
<carter> and IR should be translated to keyboard events
<dvhart> that is what I was thinkg (IR -> key)
<dvhart> so we add keycodes for NEXT END PREV PLAY etc?
<carter> yep
<dvhart> should we define keycodes in an enum or just a buttload of defines?
<carter> enum
<dvhart> I haven't given this all much thought
<carter> we will NEVER use defines
<carter> either constant integer
<carter> or enums ;)
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> I started doing that already in surface
<dvhart> do we subclass mouse event for mouse_motion and mouse_button
<dvhart> evetns?
<carter> yep
<carter> mouse motion is a problem
<carter> btw
<dvhart> event, mouse_event, key_event are abstract then?
<carter> :)
<carter> if we want to have mouse over effects
<carter> 2 widgets need to be *evented* *lol*
<carter> the one which lost the mouse focus
<carter> and the one wo got it
<carter> so we need something like mouse_enter
<carter> mouse_exit
<dvhart> those are signals
<carter> yep
<dvhart> for each widget
<carter> but they have a fundamental problem
<carter> we cant only send mouse events
<carter> to the current widget then
<carter> which kicks our whole event handling chain ;)
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter> at least the one in my mind ;)
<dvhart> yup yup
<carter> *damnit :)*
<carter> ok
<carter> so
<dvhart> well, mouse events have been kinda added in last minute
<carter> we change the wording: :)
<dvhart> as we won't use them much IMO
<carter> keyboard events
<carter> go to the current widget
<carter> mouse events to the widget, currently under the mouse button
<dvhart> yup
<carter> and mouse_pressed events
<carter> first activate the widget
<carter> under the current mouse pos
<carter> and then get send to the active widget
<carter> ok
<carter> works out ok ;)
<dvhart> so too widget pointers
<dvhart> cur_widget and hover_widget
<dvhart> or somehting
<carter> hmmmmmmmmmmmm
<carter> damnit
<dvhart> need prev_hover_widget too lol
<carter> do you think its too slow to go trough the widget hierachie top down
<carter> each time the mouse moves?
<carter> current hover widget isnt neccesary to maintain
<dvhart> QT does I think
<carter> (redundant state)
<carter> because by the current mouse position
<carter> you can always find out which is the "current hover widget"
<dvhart> state->get_widget_at(x, y)
<carter> yep
<carter> but you are right
<carter> we need a cur_hover_widget
<carter> and
<carter> when a mousemove is made
<carter> and get_widget returns a different one
<carter> then  on cur_hover_widget( which is then old) the mouse_exit event is send
<dvhart> <carter> current hover widget isnt neccesary to maintain
<carter> and on the new one the mouse entry event is send
<carter> yeahyeah  ;) though about it some more , we do need it
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> I foloow you
<dvhart> so.. does app or state maintain it
<dvhart> app I think
<carter> imo app has to maintain current widget pointers
<dvhart> then app asks the current state for the new widget at x,y
<carter> yep
<carter> so
<dvhart> sounds clean enough to me
<carter> how do we update
<carter> the current keyboard focus
<carter> and
<carter> who is responsible
<carter> for changing it?
<dvhart> so the container has a set_next_focus()
<dvhart> ...
<carter> who calls it?
<carter> and how does the container
<carter> tell the state/app that it has changed?
<dvhart> so a NEXT key event gets sent to the focuses widget (a button)
<dvhart> it doesn't know what to fo, calls the parent container
<dvhart> and then... to tell the app
<dvhart> this was a problem in stk1 also
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter> so
<dvhart> what did we do...
<carter> we have one more interface
<carter> in parent :)
<dvhart> uh oh
<carter> hmmmm
<carter> still thinking
<dvhart> hmm
<carter> if it isnt cleaner
<carter> if we just make
<carter> widget aware of its parent APP
<dvhart> what about passing events up the hierarchy that app can handle
<carter> or parent state
<carter> ok
<dvhart> like I_WANT_THE_SURFACE
<carter> yep
<dvhart> then app calls draw
<carter> that was the next  thing i thought
<carter> I WANT THE SURFACE not
<carter> imo
<carter> that is very clean with the interface
<dvhart> lol
<carter> but we could just let a 
<carter> CYCLE_WIDGET event
<carter> or something
<carter> up
<dvhart> why not DRAW_ME too
<carter> to change the currently active widget
<carter> to the next ONE
<dvhart> hmm
<carter> dunno :)
<dvhart> next one
* carter liked the idea of drawing with the interface
<carter> ;)
<dvhart> how does app know that is?
<carter> ???
<dvhart> CYCLE_WIDGET
<dvhart> app gets it
<carter> ah
<carter> you mean
<carter> what the next widget is
<dvhart> changes cur_widget to ?? what?
<carter> :)yeah
<carter> that is kinda problem :)
<dvhart> the event could contain a pointer
<carter> I M O  
<carter> app should call a function
<carter> which starts with the parent of the currently active widget
<carter> and calls something like
<carter> damn
<carter> my
<dvhart> set_next_focus just returns the pointer
<dvhart> that works
<carter> >
<carter> key doesnt work
<carter> with Xfree 4.3
<carter> dvhart
<carter> imo
<carter> it should start
<carter> with the parent of the currently active widget
<carter> and call something like
<carter> parent-Next(current_widget)
<carter> which EITHER
<carter> returns the next one
<carter> or 
<carter> some special value
<carter> for END OF LIST
<carter> so
<carter> when it returned the next one
<carter> we traverse the next one DOWN (if its and container) or just take it as the current one
<carter> if it returned end of list
<carter> we go to the parent of parent (upward the hierarchie)
<carter> and try again to get the next one there
<carter> next should return the first child if we call it with a null pointer as the current one 
<carter> IMO
<dvhart> ok, I think we are on the same page
<dvhart> what about this
<dvhart> current widget gets a NEXT keypress
<dvhart> it doesn't know what to do
<dvhart> it gets passed up eventually to app
<dvhart> app says cur_widget = cur_widget->parent->next()
<carter> dvhart
<carter> hmm
<carter> ok continue ;)
<dvhart> that's it
<carter> doesnt work
<dvhart> works clean
<carter> if we have multiple levels of containers
<carter> what if the parent reached its end of childs list
<dvhart> thats ok
<carter> then we would have to continue
<dvhart> that is container specific
<carter> one level higher in the hierarchie
<carter> ok
<carter> that is just a matter of where to implement it
<carter> :)
<carter> the tricky thing here is the implementation
<carter> but IMO
<carter> the app should only respond to events
<carter> NEXT_WIDGET
<carter> PREVIOUS_WIDGET
<carter> and the keypresses get translated
<carter> either in WIDGET
<carter> or if there is no special behaviour
<carter> in all the widgets
<carter> it gets handled
<carter> in State
<carter> so a widget could implement special behaviour
<carter> to jump out of the current widget, when another key is pressed
<carter> that makes it possible to trigger the next widget thingie from different sources
<dvhart> hmm, why translate the key in widget, doesn't it make more sense to only translatethe key in one place (and won't the same key change widgets throught the entire APP) ?
<carter> no
<carter> in the Usual case
<carter> of switching with TAB and arrow left/right
<carter> it gets translated in STATE or App
<carter> sorta like a default behaviour
<carter> but it might get translated earlier
<dvhart> ok
<carter> by one of the widgets
<carter> for special behaviour
<dvhart> ok, like END in a list
<dvhart> ?
<carter> what END in a list?
<dvhart> you are focused on the 3rd entry in a list, you press END, you are now focused on the last item in the list
<carter> yep
<dvhart> ok
<carter> but
<carter> a listbox
<carter> hasnt got to change the current widget for that
<carter> because its no container
<carter> remember? :)
<dvhart> so I am a little fuzzy on how the messaging work, so run me through your idea for the entire process of the END example I mentioned
<dvhart> oh right
<dvhart> well
<carter> the END example
<dvhart> another exmample then
<carter> isnt done trough messaging ;)
<carter> and END
<carter> of a container
<carter> is very unintuitive
<carter> :)
<dvhart> yup
<dvhart> ok so I press ->
<dvhart> what happens
<carter> the event
<carter> KEYpressed
<carter> with keycode==arrrow_right
<carter> get send to the current widget
<carter> which either handles it (spreadsheet comes to minD)
<carter> or just doesnt handle it, so it calls the handle_event method of the parent
<carter> etc etc etc
<carter> eventually it gets passed up to app
<carter> which then decides to handle it like 
<carter> WIDGET_NEXT
<carter> (effectively translating it into WIDGET_NEXT)
<dvhart> by calling cur_widget = cur_widget->parent()->next() ?
<carter> yep
<carter> and the container has to make sure
<dvhart> hmmmm..... I thought that is what I said originally *g*
<carter> that the next one is returned
<carter> no
<carter> imo you said
<carter> imo
<carter> you wanted to either only react on the key
<carter> or send NEXT to the active widget
<carter> might be that i didnt got your inital suggestion though ;) (getting late *lol*)
<dvhart> ok, miscommunication, I think we got it
<dvhart> 6: button group and toggle buttons
<dvhart> we have toggle_container
<carter> yep
<carter> imo
<dvhart> ie button_group
<carter> a toggle and radio button grup etc
<carter> is just a normal container
<carter> so all "groupable" items in one container are one group
<carter> implementation might get a bit tricky though ;)
<carter> or do you want to make special containers?
<dvhart> the UML has a toggle_container
<dvhart> so that it can handle a clicked event
<dvhart> by unsetting the other buttons in the group
<dvhart> a toggle button knows to tell its parent that it got clicked
<carter> yep
<carter> ok
<carter> right
<dvhart> the parent may or may not handle it
<carter> and the client handling is special
<carter> too
<carter> you need to make a subclass of widget
<carter> ah
<carter> wait
<carter> imo
<carter> we have 2 kinds of toggle buttons
<carter> we have simply Toggle buttons
<carter> and we have alternative selection buttons
<carter> simple toggle buttons havent got to be treaten special
--> gregf (~gregf@d-216-195-154-239.gwi.net) has joined #linux-coding
<carter> IMO
<carter> hi gregf
<dvhart> (so put toggle buttons in container and alternative slection buttons in toggle_ocntainer)
<gregf> lo
<dvhart> lo gregf
<carter> dvhart: 
<carter> imo
<carter> toggle container should be called
<carter> alternative_toggle_container
<carter> or something
<carter> and
<carter> all alternative selectable wigets
<carter> have to derive from one class between them adn the widget class
<carter> for the special interface
<dvhart> we can rename the container
<carter> and the child list of a alternative_toggle_container has to contain pointers
<carter> to that special interface class
<carter> instead of a simple widget
<dvhart> hmmm
<dvhart> that complicates things
<carter> imow
<dvhart> it means the container derives from widget
<dvhart> and can't be a parent
<carter> we shouldnt implement that now
<carter> and talk about it
<carter> when the basic framework is in place
<carter> KISS for now
<dvhart> hmmm
<carter> it will get much cleaner
<carter> when the rest is there
<carter> IMO ;)
<dvhart> so we get labels and buttons working
<carter> thats the most important thing atm!
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> 7: parent type specified in constructor
<dvhart> to restrict the parent type of specific widgets (ie radio button)
<carter> boost::weak_pointer«container» 
<dvhart> we se tthe parent type in the constructor
<carter> hmmmmm??????
<dvhart> see the uml
<carter> how do you mean that?
<dvhart> all widget derivitives
<carter> yeah sure?
<dvhart> require a parent in the constructor
<carter> yep
<dvhart> BUT
<dvhart> we can seay what kind of parent
<dvhart> as long as it
<dvhart> derives from widget
<carter> dvhart so what is the problem?
<dvhart> nothing
<carter> each widget can redefine what type of parent it has
<carter> :)
<dvhart> asking if you kike it
<carter> imo there's no need to discuss it :)
<carter> its ok IMO
<dvhart> ok
<dvhart> anything else you want to bring up?
<carter> atm not
<carter> but there are many things we changed today :)
<dvhart> ok thanks for the back board
<dvhart> I will update the UML
<carter> maybe my might might change till tomorrow ;)
<dvhart> and commit it
<carter> ok
<carter> mail to the ML when its commmited
<carter> will look at it then
<dvhart> ok
<carter> see if you got everything right ;))
<dvhart> *g* so how is stunts coming
<carter> havent done anything on it
<carter> since 2 weeks
<carter> :)
<carter> much work
<carter> and codec has got some exams
<carter> no time
<dvhart> too bad
<carter> last thing i implemented
<carter> was a hierarchical state change optimisation algorithm
<carter> for the rendering
<carter> :)
<carter> kinda nice ;)
<dvhart> ?
<carter> orders the state changes by the impact
<carter> in Opengl every state change
<carter> like gl_enable(gl_light)
<carter> has a performance impact
<carter> which varies with the type of change
<carter> so when you render multiple objects
<carter> you try to group the similiar state's together
<carter> to minimize performance loss
<carter> so i made a  tree which has the expensive state changes
<carter> in the upper nodes
<carter> and the inexpensive in the lower nodes
<carter> and render top down
<carter> so the inexpensive state changes are done oftne
<carter> and the expensive ones aehm
<carter> damn
<carter> what was the word
* carter 's english is getting worse ;)
<carter> aeh
<carter> negative of often? :)
<carter> ok
<dvhart> seldom
<carter> :)
<carter> i think you got it
<carter> ahh right
<carter> :9
<dvhart> very cool
<dvhart> think it'll actually get finished?
<carter> stunts?
<carter> dunno:)
<dvhart> yup
<carter> we want to get something playable as fast as possible
<dvhart> I can't wait to see it
<carter> to maybe get some additional developers on it :)
<carter> but that will take a few month i think from now
<carter> cant invest much time in it
<dvhart> yup
<carter> (and STK is interesting too ;) )
<dvhart> I want to help too
<carter> yep
<carter> :)
<dvhart> but I have to finish a couple others first
<carter> yep
<dvhart> work, research, stk, you get the idea
<carter> ok
<carter> :)))
* carter is AFI, watching some tv(farscape)
<dvhart> so, good session!
<carter> cya later
<dvhart> thanks
<carter> nop
<dvhart> nite carter
<carter> n8
* dvhart saves the session to dvhart_carter_architecture.txt
