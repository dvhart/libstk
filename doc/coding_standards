RFC, Draft

1:Naming Conventions
1.1:Private vars: All private variables use _ as a suffix.
1.2:Variable names must be descriptive, lower case, separated with _.
    ie: temp_widget is good.  TempWidget, t, tWidget, and wtTemp are not. 

2:Code formatting:
2.1:Indentation use the Ansi Identation style {} on their own line etc, look @ astyle docu for complete spec(astyle.sf.net)
2.2: Spaces
2.3.1: Every comma should be followed be a space
2.3.2: All assignment and comparator operators (=, |=, &=, ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=, etc.) should be 
       wrapped by single spaces
2.3.3: Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, etc) need not be wrapped by single spaces as equations can
       become unnecessariliy long with them (this is left to the developer's discretion)
2.3.4: All condition keywords (if, while, for, etc.) should be followed by a single space, ie if ()
2.3.5: Parenthesis may have a single whitespace separating their conents if it added legibility,
       (this is left to the developer's discretion), ie if ( (a & 0x10) && (b & 0x01) )

3:Property Accessor Methods
3:1 property() and property(T val), not get_property() and set_property()
