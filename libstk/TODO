MEETING TOPICS
==============
- discuss surfaces: creation, blitting, etc.
- tab stops
- discuss embedded widgets
  what types of widgets make sense in embedded devices ?
	    combo box are very mouse oriented for example, what types of widgets
	    are IR Remote friendly ?
- what image formats do we want to support ? xpm, png, bmp, etc...
      how do we want to add load routines?  as functors in a map based on magic
			number?  some way to register a loader?  or KISS and only support a couple
			simple formats since the user can always convert, say XPM and PPM for
			simplicity's sake?
- should we have a color manager, similar to the font manager - dvhart to write test impl
- should we use rectangle::ptr, string::ptr, etc everywhere?  it is awkward to have 
      a method receive a "const rectangle&" and a "image::ptr"
- add support for multiple screens (ie VFD on fron panel and SVIDEO to television)
