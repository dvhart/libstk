MEETING TOPICS
==============
surface::lock - do we return a format, or always 32 bit RGBA.  If always rgba,
  we need a way to know what rect was requested by the lock call so we can convert
  and write back to the correct place in the buffer.


TASKS (Some duplicated items here and below)
============================================
Axe pointless bool returns in API and create a bind_return syntax
Spinner - (AUTOCOMPLETE, NO EDIT)
Purge all magic numbers
Scrollbars - Marc to finish
Scrollbox - Marc to finish
Combo Box - Darren to write
Edit Box (could be prettier, setting cursor/selection support on click and via API needed)
Text Area - simple, no line break strategy, just \n and spaces, editable parameter and scroll model
          - wrap visually, don't modify content
Markup Area (simple html renderer ?)
Surface blitting / locking / creation (from app surface ?) - YES, ADD virtual create(...) to surface classes
Input Capabilities - Marc to write (if deemed necessary, may not be)
Template list_item for users to derive from
Image (png loader, own surface, blit) - Marc todo after images have surface members
SDL - look into offscreen surfaces (can they be created prior to the main screen?)
surface: finish locking and add pixel_format routine
surface_fbdev - Vernon to finish
event_producer_linux - Darren to finish
event_producer_directfb
IR support (IRDA / generic serial / lirc) ?
Software Pointer (common to all graphic backends) - YES, make part of surface backends
Document all existing classes / APIs
