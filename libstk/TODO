MEETING TOPICS
==============
surface::lock - do we return a format, or always 32 bit RGBA.  If always rgba,
  we need a way to know what rect was requested by the lock call so we can convert
  and write back to the correct place in the buffer.


TASKS (Some duplicated items here and below)
============================================
Exceptions (need class hierarchy, declare throws, use them...)
Spinner - (AUTOCOMPLETE, NO EDIT)
Template list_item for users to derive from
Purge all magic numbers
Scrollbars - Marc to finish
Combo Box - Darren to write
Edit Box (could be prettier, setting selection via API needed)
Markup Area (simple html renderer ?)
Surface blitting / locking / creation (from app surface ?) - YES
surface: finish locking and add pixel_format routine
surface_fbdev - Vernon to finish
SDL - look into offscreen surfaces (can they be created prior to the main screen?)
Software Pointer (common to all graphic backends) - YES, make part of surface backends
Input Capabilities - Marc to write (if deemed necessary, may not be)
event_producer_linux - Darren to finish
event_producer_directfb
IR support (IRDA / generic serial / lirc) ?
Document all existing classes / APIs
Get libstk license approved by OSI
Finalize font interface / implementation - more discussion
Add STL style iterator interface to container

COMPLETED TASKS
===============
dvhart: tab order code removed (maybe add for libstk 2.0)
dvhart: list_item user_data removed
dvhart: widget regions (define in theme, check in handle_event() on clicks)
dvhart: numeric_spinner added
dvhart: make all header conditional include defines conform to STK_FILENAME_H
dvhart: rename PARENT INTERFACE to COMPONENT INTERFACE
dvhart: List Item Height is no longer fixed to 25 pixels, fixed in theme, list, and list_item
dvhart: widgets are now positioned relative to their parent container
dvhart: Polish the build environment (added checks for boost, directfb, libpng, freetype, etc)
dvhart: Added libstk to freshmeat
dvhart: Converted all output to new logger
carter: Image (png loader, own surface, blit)
dvhart: added multiselect to list
dvhart: added override_return for bool(void) signals (still need support for one argument signals)
dvhart: added xine_panel (some memory management work still needed)
cslade: added a text area, and another test app (test_area) to test the text_area
dvhart: scroll_box added

DOCUMENTATION
=============
dependecy / compile instructions
decide on a format
ie:
    /// This is a brief description, until the dot.
    /// This is a detailed description of the entity immmediately
    /// below these lines of the description
    class|function { }
write it!!!!
