MEETING TOPICS

- usage of signals (only for the user?)
- global key bindings (accelerators ?)
- license - define intent
- tab stops
- discuss embedded widgets
  what types of widgets make sense in embedded devices ?
	    combo box are very mouse oriented for example, what types of widgets
	    are IR Remote friendly ?
- what image formats do we want to support ? xpm, png, bmp, etc...
- should we have a color manager, similar to the font manager ?
- it is getting to be a hassle to define different parameters for each theme
      draw routine, perhaps we can just pass the widget itself ?  Marc mentioned
			a parameter class... but it may just grow to be nearly as big as the widget
			itself... so why bother...
- should we use rectangle::ptr, string::ptr, etc everywhere?  it is awkward to have 
      a method receive a "const rectangle&" and a "image::ptr"
