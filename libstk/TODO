widget destructor should destroy all its children

make all widget functions virtual

use set_text to set a message for stk_progress (toggle showing %|msg)

??Modify stk_font to use 2 font.raw files, one for fill and the other for outline.
The theme should then have two color also.

??add up,down,left,right widget pointers to stk_widget and a default handler 
of the same arrow keys for better state navigation - better yet, use a STL container... map?

add member variables for all theme items that are copied from the theme on 
creation but can be set later so items can be unique, regardless of theme.

finish converting from char * to std::string (stk_font and stk_theme)

abstract SDL
     typedef SDLKey stkkey;

bind default arguments to signals (like the calling widget)

use vector for list_items (array_o_combos) bad
ie std::vector <stk_list_item> items;
items.push_back( stk_list_item("balaslfafdf") );

make item class inside list_box
ie. stk::list_box::item

let buttons have image and label children... or maybe just as members...

remove the border from the image
add a frame widget... ??
