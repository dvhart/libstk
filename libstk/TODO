MEETING TOPICS
==============
- discuss surfaces: creation, blitting, etc.
- tab stops
- should we use rectangle::ptr, string::ptr, etc everywhere?  it is awkward to have 
      a method receive a "const rectangle&" and a "image::ptr"

DOCUMENTATION
=============
dependecy / compile instructions
decide on a format
ie:
    /// This is a brief description, until the dot.
    /// This is a detailed description of the entity immmediately
    /// below these lines of the description
    class|function { }
write it!!!!

OTHER
======
png image loader - Marc
input_capabilities - Marc
Better font loading error messages.
list::create(boost::shared_ptr< list > parent, std::wstring label, std::string data)
    we are mixing std::string and std::wstring here, 
We shouldnt be using a string for "data" anyway!!! (marc)
