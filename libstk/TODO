MEETING TOPICS
==============
- discuss surfaces: creation, blitting, etc.
- tab stops
- discuss embedded widgets
  what types of widgets make sense in embedded devices ?
	    combo box are very mouse oriented for example, what types of widgets
	    are IR Remote friendly ?
- should we use rectangle::ptr, string::ptr, etc everywhere?  it is awkward to have 
      a method receive a "const rectangle&" and a "image::ptr"
- add support for multiple screens (ie VFD on fron panel and SVIDEO to television)

DOCUMENTATION
=============
dependecy / compile instructions
decide on a format

    /// This is a brief description, until the dot.
    /// This is a detailed description of the entity immmediately
    /// below these lines of the description
    class|function { }
write it!!!!
