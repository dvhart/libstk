<h1>Libstk::Overview</h1>
<p>
Libstk is designed to meet the user interface needs of embedded media devices, particularly those of the increasing number of set-top boxes.  As it has been designed specifically for these devices, Libstk handles their unique input and display requirements efficiently.

<p>
With the many target architectures of set-top box applications in mind, Libstk has been designed from the start as a light-weight, cross platform toolkit.  Written entirely in C++, Libstk has a small memory footprint and runs natively on popular embedded processors, without the need for a virtual machine and the accompanying demands on hardware.

<p>
Taking advantage of advanced C++ design methodologies, such as smart pointers and signals, Libstk simplifies application development with an intelligent and powerful API.  SMart pointers perform automatic garbage collection, allowing developers to focus their attention on the application itselg.  Signals provide a powerful mechanism for widget interaction and event handling.
