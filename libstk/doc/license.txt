EXCEPTION NOTICE

1. You may use, link (staticly or dynamicly), modify and distribute binary 
versions of works that use this library under your own terms.  

2. If you copy code from files distributed under the terms of the GNU General 
Public Licence or the GNU Library General Public Licence into a copy of this 
library, as this licence permits, the exception does not apply to the code that
you add in this way.  To avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such

adjust the licensing conditions notice accordingly.

3. Modifications to the existing library source must be made in accordance with
this license and be presented for inclusion in the primary distribution of this
library.  Additions to Libstk, in the form of new widgets, themes, event 
systems, and surface classes are not considered modifications to the existing
library and may be licensed under your own terms.

NOTE: this is different from wx-windows, but I *thought* this is want we wanted
to say.  Or do we want companies to be able to modify the library and not 
release the source.  You would think I would know what I want...  I hate legalease.
