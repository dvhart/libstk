in order to build and install the lib and tests do th following

$tar -xzvf libstk.tar.gz
$cd libstk
$./autogen.sh
$./configure
$make install

In order to build the test applications:
$cd tests
$make
If you want to install the test app
$make install
To run the test app (from the tests directory)
$./stk_test

That should do it
if not, check that you have the libs installed in
    /usr/local/stk/lib/libstk*

and the header files in
    /usr/local/stk/include/*.h

and the themes/fonts/images in
    /usr/local/stk/share/themes
    /usr/local/stk/share/images
    /usr/local/stk/share/fonts
respectively
